###Comparison of the matter power spectrum computed by using only camb (red) and the *FrankenEmu*  emulator (blue)


Fiducial refer to s8 = 0.83, b1 =1.8, z=2.7

###Comparison of the correlation function associated to the non-linear power spectrum (or FrankEmu), using an straightforward integration (implemented by Anze) and using the FFTlog, displayed as follows:

###As a double check, we plot best-fit theoretical curves along with measurements

###Considering the 100 Jacknives provided by Sukhdeep - mocks_RST_steps_rebin1_DM1 -, we computed the best-fit set of parameters and plot them, i.e. **b1 below**

###then, take mean values and 1-standard deviation (multitply by x10), and get the following graph

###Similar thing got Sukhdeep!

###And for the simulations

##Sergio provided new mocks with fixed number clustering and number density.
The results seem very consitent with values expected of b1, b2 and s8.
