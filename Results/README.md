###Comparison of the correlation function associated to the non-linear power spectrum (or FrankEmu), using an straightforward integration (implemented by Anze) and using the FFTlog, displayed as follows:

###As a double check, we plot best-fit theoretical curves along with measurements

###Considering the 100 Jacknives provided by Sukhdeep - mocks_RST_steps_rebin1_DM1 -, we computed the best-fit set of parameters and plot them, i.e. **b1 below**

###then, take mean values and 1-standard deviation (multitply by x10), and get the following graph
